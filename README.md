This project is an inventory management software mixed with a web-based point of sale program.

It is split into two parts, the front end which is what someone who visits the store sees, as well as a backend, which 
includes all the manual alterations of inventory as well as a list of all the orders and such. It automatically updates
inventory. 

It allows you to print the orders as well as lets you mark the orders as picked or cancel them.
